h1. Generative Projections for SLG


Patch for this exhibition: "http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding":http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding

* Display image frames & play sounds from the data directory for each of 3 projectors in phasing loops.
* Edit each of the timeline arrays to determine when to fire events.
* Change the probability to determine the likelihood of each timeline event firing.

Will likely use Syphon to plug through VDMX for the final presentation!

h2. Configure


Run in "Processing":http://processing.org (3.0).
