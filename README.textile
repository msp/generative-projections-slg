h1. Generative Projections for SLG


Patch for this exhibition: "http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding":http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding

* Display image frames & play sounds from the data directory for each of 3 projectors in phasing loops.
* Edit each of the timeline arrays to determine when to fire events.
* Change the probability to determine the likelihood of each timeline event firing.

Will likely use Syphon to plug through VDMX for the final presentation!

h2. Configure

Run in "Processing":http://processing.org (3.0).

It currently requires the "Processing Sound":https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/ library. "Install":https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library with Sketch > Import Library > Add Library.
