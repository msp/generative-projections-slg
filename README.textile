Patch for this exhibition: "http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding":http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/sally-golding

* Display image frames & play sounds from the data directory for each of 3 projectors in phasing loops.

* Change the probability to determine the likelihood of each timeline event firing.

Run in "Processing":http://processing.org (3.0).

It currently requires the "Beads Processing":http://www.beadsproject.net library. "Install":https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library with Sketch > Import Library > Add Library.

Beads depends on an install of "Jack":http://jackaudio.org for multi channel sound. See this "forum thread":https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/16611/multichannel-audio#latest for more info.
